    "Before training our classifier, several preprocessing steps are advisable. The first one imputes nan values with the factor mean to get clean training data, the second scales our factor ranks to be between [0, 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "For training we are using the [AdaBoost classifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AdaBoost) which automatically determines the most relevant features (factors) and tries to find a non-linear combination of features to maximize predictiveness while still being robust. In essence, AdaBoost trains an ensemble of weak classifiers (decision trees in this case) sequentially. Each subsequent weak classifier takes into account the samples (or data points) already classified by the previous weak classifiers. It then focuses on the samples misclassified by the previous weak classifiers and tries to get those correctly. With each new weak classifier you get more fine-grained in your decision function and correctly classify some previously misclassified samples. For prediction, you simply average the answer of all weak classifiers to get a single strong classifier.\n",
